16. Session management in microservices
17. How will u identify which logs are for which user in microservice when multiple users access microservice -> Using zipkin and scaling microservices
18. what if size of message is greater than partition size in kafka? will exception be thrown ? or what happens
19.What is the default msg size we can send to broker in kafka
20. what are the params for sending msg to kafka topic ? Is their a possible way of sending msg to particular topic ?

22. What is the use case of immutablilty? Where and when we use immutable classes?
23. @Primary annotation in spring ?
24. What if a topic has 5 partitions. Total there are 100 msgs from all partitions. And there are 20 consumers . Can all 20 consumers consume
msgs paralley from that topic or how many consumers can consume msgs parallely at given point of time
