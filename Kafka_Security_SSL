1. SetUp Certificates

For that we use Certifacte Authority(CA)

On Server/Broker
We have to create KeyStore - This will store Certificates
So first we will send request to sign the certicate for broker(kafka1.example.com)
CA now signs this certicate
Now in keyStore we will have server/broker certificates, signed by CA

On Client side
We have truststore similar to keyStore on server side
truststore has to trust the CA(meaning any certicate signed by CA is ligid)

For this in Client we create "CA Root public certificate" which holds list of all valid CA's.


Now when client wants to connect to broker, it sends a request to broker.
Broker sends its SSL certificate signed by CA to client.
Client now validates this certificate using the truststore which contains list of all CA's and checks if the CA mentioned in certicate is
 present in list of CA's it holds in truststore

 Once its agreed that CA is valid and hence certificate submitted by broker is valid, secure SSL encrypted communication between client and server
